# Enum
Just a simple script to do some basic enumeration of a target system

Lastly, thank you to Technet for having all of the documentation I could want

I know the enumeration isn't quite perfect, this is still a work in progress that will be updated from time to time.
I still have a lot of work to do in regards to suggesting exploits, I know there's more that goes into it than just
checking for patches. Though I hope to add other functionality in due time. I am by no means a coder, so I'm sure there
are more efficient ways of performing many if not all of these tasks, but this works for me. Any advice on better practices
are more than appreciated. Enjoy!
